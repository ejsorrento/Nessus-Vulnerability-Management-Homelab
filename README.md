![7_What_Is_Nessus](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b516bb17-ab03-435d-b9c8-230d4fc3fcbf)

**Summary**

**Platforms and Technology Used:** Tenable Nessus and Windows 10 virtual machine on VirtualBox
Installed and configured Nessus Essentials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 host.
Implemented Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox network:
-Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify.
Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; identified and remediated risks and vulnerabilities
Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software.


**Prologue**

**Vulnerability management** is a practice that is ongoing and entails identifying, evaluating, reporting, and addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities present in endpoints, workloads, and systems. **MITRE** is a highly respected organization in the information security real and provides critical frameworks such as the **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposres (CVE)** and the **Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)** framework, which play a vital role in the comprehension and remediation of vulnerabilities and threats.

The goal of this homelab is to obtain practical skills in utilizing the free version of **Tenable Nessus**, known as **Nessus Essentials** and gain proficiency in vulnerability scanning and administering remediation tactics. This project highlights two vital stages of the "Vulnerability Management Lifecycle" and it is done through the use of Nessues Essentials for vulnerability scan hosted on virtual machines on Oracle VM VirtualBox. In this exercise, I will demonstrate the running of credentialed scans to identify vulnerabilities, remediation tactics to resolve identified issues, and initiating of a follow-up scan to verify the successful remediation of the issues.

**Necessary Downloads:**

• Oracle VM VirtualBox for your operating system: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

• Windows 10: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO

• Tenable Nessus Essentials: https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials

Go ahead and get started by downloading VirtualBox, the installation is straight forward and you'll be left with a landing screen similar to what is seen below.

_Note, my VirtualBox has a few other projects listed in it, I've underlined in green the virtual machine we'll be working with to build this homelab. Utilize the above picture to put together the virtual machine we'll be creating._

Start by creating a "New" virtual machine and imputting the newly downloaded Windows ISO file into it. Configure the remainder of the settings to your preferences or to what you believe your computer is capable of processing and click "Finish" to complete the setup of the virtual machine.

Start your VM and go through the steps to set up Windows 10. Upon arriving to the homescreen, navigate to the "Command Prompt".

At this point, we'll need to test the connection between the local machine and our brand new virtual machine, we'll test the connection by pinging the VM from the local machine. If this connection is not established, we will not be able to properly run the vulnerability scans from Nessus. Currently the pings will time out on the local machine due to the active firewall on the VM that is blocking all connection attempted.

Navigate to "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security" and click "Windows Defender Firewall Properties", turn off the "Firewall State" for Domain, Private, and Public profiles. Then reattempt the ping and you will now see successful result.

_Please note, I originally ran into some issues after having alter the previously mentioned firewall settings on the virtual machine due to the fact that my VMs Network settings were "Attached to:" a NAT connection. Once I altered with connection to a Bridged Adapter, the pings began to be sent between the two machines as intended._

Move forward to the download of Nessus. I personally had an issue utilizing Nessus on a gmail account, therefore, I utilized my protonmail email address to generate the download link and aqcuire the activation code for Nessus Essentials. Download the installation file and initiaite the setup, this will take some time and you will be prompted to set up additional compilations of plugins afterward.

Once you've gotten into Nessus Essentials, begin creating a new scan and select "Basic Network Scan". Name the scan and input the IP address of the virtual machine as the Target. See below three images.

_New scan with VM's IP address, name scan and input IP address. (3/3)_

Begin running the scan.
