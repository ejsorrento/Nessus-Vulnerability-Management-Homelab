**Prologue**

**Vulnerability management** is a practice that is ongoing and entails identifying, evaluating, reporting, and addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities present in endpoints, workloads, and systems. **MITRE** is a highly respected organization in the information security real and provides critical frameworks such as the **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposres (CVE)** and the **Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)** framework, which play a vital role in the comprehension and remediation of vulnerabilities and threats.

The goal of this homelab is to obtain practical skills in utilizing the free version of **Tenable Nessus**, known as **Nessus Essentials** and gain proficiency in vulnerability scanning and administering remediation tactics. This project highlights two vital stages of the "Vulnerability Management Lifecycle" and it is done through the use of Nessues Essentials for vulnerability scan hosted on virtual machines on Oracle VM VirtualBox. In this exercise, I will demonstrate the running of credentialed scans to identify vulnerabilities, remediation tactics to resolve identified issues, and initiating of a follow-up scan to verify the successful remediation of the issues.
